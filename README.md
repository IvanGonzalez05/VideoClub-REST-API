### How to run it
- After cloning this repo
- Open the terminal and run the following command:```npm install```
- Go to the ```config.env``` file and fulfill the variables. You will notice that I left two variables involved with mongodb. Do not change them. If you do, you will not be able to connect to the database.
- Rename the file ```config.env``` to ```.env```
- Open the terminal and run: ```npm run start```
